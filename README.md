This repository contains 3D Models for an AirMeter.io device based around the LILYGO® TTGO T5 V2.3.1_2.13 board. They have been designed and tested using a Prusa i3 mk3s+ printed in 0.15mm Quality mode using PLA as the material. PrusaSlicer & OctoPrint were used to slice and print the parts. Milage with other printers & slicers may vary.
